=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<dh_bash-completion> [S<I<debhelper options>>]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

dh_bash-completion is a debhelper program that is responsible for installing
completions for bash, usable installing the "bash-completion" package.

If a file named debian/package.bash-completion exists, then different actions
are performed, depending on its format.

It can be a proper completion snippet, and in that case it would be installed
in the completion directory, and no other actions would be performed.

It can also be a list of files, with an optionally specified name to call the
completion snippet after. The file format is as follows:

  my/path/to/foo-completion       # this would be installed as "foo-completion"
  my/path/to/bar-completion  baz  # this would be installed as "baz"
